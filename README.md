![Python package](https://github.com/sergev/Pytest-Actions-Demo/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Here you can find a demo of a Python application with an automated testing using Github Actions service.

Anytime you want to start a new project in Python, feel free to use this code as a skeleton.
Copy the contents to your repository and build your code upon it.

You will need to enable Actions in your repository.

File demo.py contains a code for `factorial()` function.

File `test_demo.py` has a few tests to make sure the `factorial()` function works correctly.

To test the code from command line, run:

    pytest -v

After every commit, visit the Actions tab and review the results of automated linting and testing.

Prerequisites:

    pip3 install pytest flake8
